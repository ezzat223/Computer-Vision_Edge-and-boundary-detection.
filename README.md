# Computer-Vision_Edge-and-boundary-detection.
## 1- Canny edge detector. 
## 2- Hough Transform
####      detect lines, circles, ellipses located in these images (if any). Superimpose the detected shapes on the images.
## 3- Active Contour Model (snake).
## 4- Chain code representation, compute the perimeter and the area inside these contours.
